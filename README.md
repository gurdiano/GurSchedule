# GurSchedule

GurSchedule is a personal agenda app created by **Tiago Gurdiano**, originally inspired by a simple Excel spreadsheet.

> _"I needed a better way to organize my day. My old spreadsheet worked, but I had to constantly delete and rewrite everything as weeks went by. Since I was studying software development, I decided to turn that spreadsheet into a real app — and GurSchedule was born. It's a personal project to help me learn and grow, and I'll keep improving it whenever possible."_
